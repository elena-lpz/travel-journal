# Week 4 Assignment

A Full-Stack travel journal using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Example site: https://guestbook-3ap1.onrender.com/

# Achieved rquirements:

🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or dynamic CSS styling.
🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

# Achieved stretch goals:

🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.
🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.
🏹 Add a delete button to each message and a DELETE route in the server.

# Other extras

- Added loading screen with image and text animation
- Made a floating submission button for mobile to improve UX
- Added modals for the form for both desktop and mobile
- Styled scrollbard so that they are less "intrusive"
- Added alert messages for successful submission and deletion

## Reflection

I'm satisfied with my submission in general, though a bit unhappy with the look of it. I did not spend time doing the design this time around as I had to focus on the backend side of things more before I could start working on the frontend, which altered the way I had been working up until now. I think I should have maybe structured my time better and set up a clear path to follow, as it all became a bit chaotic for me at some points. I think the main issue was that I was not as excited or interested in this week's project. I had ideas to make it better and make me enjoy it more, but they were a bit too complex and would have required more time. I did enjoy working on the backend a lot, and surprisingly I did not enjoy the frontend side of things as much as I usually do.
